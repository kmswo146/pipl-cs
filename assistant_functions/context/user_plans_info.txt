User Plans & Workspace Context Information:

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- User from conversation may not be the user to lookup
- Users can join someone else's workspace
- Always check workspace membership and permissions
- Plan limits apply to workspace, not individual users

KEY FIELDS TO CHECK:
- user.workspace_id: Which workspace the user belongs to
- workspace.plan_id: Which plan the workspace is on
- workspace.owner_email: Who owns/pays for the workspace
- plan.features: What features are available
- plan.limits: Usage limits (emails/month, campaigns, etc.)

COMMON SCENARIOS:
- User asks about "their" plan but they're on someone else's workspace
- Need to check who actually pays for the workspace
- Different users in same workspace have different permissions
- Plan limits affect all users in the workspace

COLLECTIONS (UPDATE WITH YOUR ACTUAL STRUCTURE):
- users: User profiles and workspace membership
- workspaces: Workspace details and plan information
- plans: Plan definitions with features and limits
- billing: Billing and subscription information

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If user has access issues, check workspace membership
- If feature unavailable, check plan limits
- If billing issues, check workspace owner's subscription status
