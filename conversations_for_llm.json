Issue: Clickjacking Clickjacking, also known as a UI redress attack, can trick users into performing actions they did not intend to by overlaying multiple transparent layers on a webpage. This technique can also be used to capture keystrokes. Proof of Concept: <html> <body> <iframe height=\"500\" width=\"500\" src=\" https://app.pipl.ai/v2/register/ \" ></iframe> </body> </html> Impacts: This vulnerability can be exploited to hijack user interactions, leading to unauthorized actions on your website. Recommended Fix: To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to implement the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header or the Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors directive. References: X-Frame-Options Documentation OWASP Clickjacking Guide Note: I\u2019m hoping to receive a bounty reward for my current finding. I will be looking forward to hearing from you on this and will be reporting other vulnerabilities accordingly. Kind Regards, Andrew Snapshot:"

You can try to run email placement tests in specialized tools like GlockApps to better understand where your emails are landing.

One of the reason is because warmup is composed of a pool of accounts and once inboxes in the warmup pool have communicated once, all further warmups between them may never land in spam because the positive signals have already happened. Another reason is that in warmup, we're sending different content to different email address each time.  But for your actual campaign, you're sending similar content to a lot of leads. Warmup is a good indicative measure of whether the accounts are ready. if you see a warmup health score > 95%, those accounts should be ready to start sending. \u200b"

When you use our inbox service, each client gets their own Google Workspace admin panel \u2014 meaning your entire sending setup is isolated. No one else\u2019s behavior can impact your deliverability. Some other inbox providers stack hundreds of clients under a single admin \u2014 which might work short-term, but it\u2019s risky long-term and totally outside your control. With us, you own the domain, the inbox, and the setup \u2014 and we configure everything (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, warm-up, DNS, etc.) for optimal cold email performance. Hope that clears it up :-)"

        "text": "Hi pipl.ai Team, I noticed something interesting while checking out your website, pipl.ai . It seems like you've used Google Ads to promote your business before, but your website also gets some organic search traffic occasionally. I believe I can help increase that organic traffic significantly at pipl.ai . If you want to rank higher in searches related to pipl.ai , I've found a few issues on your website like Broken Links, Page Speed Problems, HTML validation errors, and images without ALT text. These issues might be stopping you from getting more traffic. What if I fix those issues and promote your business through engaging content on platforms like social media? I'm confident that once these problems are fixed, you'll greatly improve your search ranking and traffic. And the best part is that this solution is one-time, so you won't have to keep paying for Google Ads monthly. Would you be interested in learning more? If you're interested, I\u2019d be glad to share a complimentary audit and a tailored quote for your review.\" Kind Regards, Susan Web Analyst -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: if you are interested, then I can send you \u2018 Proposal and Pricelist\u2019"

It seems like you've used Google Ads to promote your business before, but your website also gets some organic search traffic occasionally. I believe I can help increase that organic traffic significantly at pipl.ai . If you want to rank higher in searches related to pipl.ai , I've found a few issues on your website like Broken Links, Page Speed Problems, HTML validation errors, and images without ALT text. These issues might be stopping you from getting more traffic. What if I fix those issues and promote your business through engaging content on platforms like social media? I'm confident that once these problems are fixed, you'll greatly improve your search ranking and traffic. And the best part is that this solution is one-time, so you won't have to keep paying for Google Ads monthly. Would you be interested in learning more? If yes, I'd be happy to send you a no-obligation audit report and quote.

I noticed Pipl's innovative approach to automated lead qualification integrates AI to enhance sales efficiency and conversion rates. However, securing qualified leads that demonstrate real buying intent can still be a challenge in a competitive landscape, potentially leading to wasted resources on unqualified prospects.

Here's a brief example of how we personalize campaigns: Subject: Transforming Lead Qualification for B2B SaaS with AI Hi Gnani.ai Team, I was impressed by your insightful article on your website about the inefficiencies of manual lead qualification, particularly how it emphasizes the hidden costs involved in this outdated method. Your commitment to showcasing the transformative power of AI through tools like Inya.ai resonates deeply with our mission at Pipl. As a leader in B2B SaaS, we understand the specific challenges you face, such as the risk of slow lead qualification resulting in missed opportunities. Our automated lead qualification system leverages AI and machine learning to streamline this process, ensuring that your sales teams can prioritize genuinely interested leads without the lengthy delays. For instance, one of our clients in the SaaS sector experienced a 30% increase in conversion rates after implementing our system, as they could engage high-intent leads in real time, effectively reducing their customer acquisition costs. I would love to discuss how we can help Gnani.ai enhance your lead qualification process even further. Would you be open to a brief conversation? Best regards, Pipl Team Notice how this example email demonstrates deep personalization by addressing Gnani.ai's specific needs and challenges. How our service helps Pipl acquire customers: Lead identification: Finding the right prospects for your solution Deep personalization: Crafting emails that demonstrate understanding of each prospect Permanent prospect database: Building a targeted list of potential customers you own forever Market coverage: Continuously expanding your prospect list to cover your entire addressable market End-to-end management: Handling the entire outreach process Premium asset creation: Developing custom PDFs, images, or other assets for campaigns Our clients have seen significant improvements in their outreach efforts and conversion rates.

Looking at your sending frequency over the past 7 days for this server linked in the screenshot below. https://share.zight.com/kpur6P5k This issue looks to have started on May 6th at 8:00pm EDT time if this helps to investigate on your end to note. To resolve this, I would suggest keeping mailboxes under this server warming for 1-2 weeks and pause live outreach towards Google until delivery towards them improves, as this should recover in time due to catching this issue early. You may also want to try running your initial message copy through Mailreach or Glockapps as well as Mail-tester.com to check against Spamassassin once delivery towards Google recovers to see if this may be a potential issue with delivery. If there is anything else that I can help with for this, please let me know!"

More details about this phenomenon in our intercom chats. \u200b That new csv corresponds to the same inbox usernames but a new aged server. Also--attached are csvs for the other 3 domains in SW that tapped out and wont send/receive mails (and may be active or in ERROR in pipl.ai ) All together these 4 domains should NOW work well thanks to the aged servers.

In my previous communication, I mentioned that I couldn't locate a specific form or link to initiate the listing process.

Kindly let us know if the integration is functioning as expected and if there are any further steps required before it can go live. As mentioned before, we are available for a meeting to discuss any aspect of the integration in more detail, should that be helpful. Thank you for your continued support and guidance.

Our campaign emailed jimb11@sc.rr.com but somehow he responded back from jim.bonni123@gmail.com (his gmail instead). We had no idea though. Screenshots below for your convenience. Another problem it creates is our campaign keeps emailing him all of the sequences because his reply is not registering. I assume this is happening for others too who have some sort of forwarding/different reply-from rules setup. Digging through each of our 20 different email addresses manually is too laborious. Is there any way to fix this? We'd like to have Pipl continue to be our single source to manage all emails in one place.

That means we're optimized for 1:1-style messages that look and feel personal (vs. bulk marketing-style emails). \u200b That said, if you want to send messages to new website subscribers as part of a personalized outbound flow , you can totally do that using Pipl.ai. Just keep in mind: Emails will be sent from your own connected inbox , so yes \u2014 your subscribers will receive the message from your email address. If it\u2019s a new domain or inbox, we recommend warming it up first . Pipl.ai has built-in warmup you can use to make sure you don\u2019t land in spam. If you're planning to send transactional or marketing-style emails (like Mailchimp does), you might be better off using a traditional ESP like Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc."

We are currently working on integrating Pipl.ai into our platform\u2019s marketplace. During this process, we have discovered that some features required for our integration are not available under our current free plan. To proceed effectively, we kindly request that our account be upgraded to a business plan. Additionally, we are unable to locate the API key necessary for our integration. Please find attached a screenshot showing the API key request, which indicates that the business plan is required to grant access. We would appreciate it if you could provide us with the API key once our account is upgraded. Furthermore, to facilitate the development and testing of the integration, we would like to request the following: Verification Meeting: Once the integration is complete, we would appreciate the opportunity for a brief verification meeting with your team. We would also be grateful if you could provide us with a sponsor account or grant access to a free trial to proceed with our work. We are happy to provide any additional details about viaSocket or discuss this collaboration further. Please feel free to reply to this email with any questions or if you\u2019d like to proceed with this initiative. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to your response.

Anything above 90% generally means there is no major issue with your infrastructure setup, and neither your domain nor IP is blacklisted.

This is mainly because the warmup pool involves exchanging emails between users, and once a few positive signals are triggered, such as moving warmup emails from spam to inbox, the ESP may stop flagging the same sender account. In addition, warmup emails are usually unique, whereas campaign emails often send out the same content in bulk, which can easily trigger spam filters."

Glad Absolutely disgusting experience with the lead team from Romania. Not only did they not communicate that they wouldn\u2019t in fact be delivered in minutes, the whole communication since I ordered it is very slow and vague. Even though we pay for premium support. No leads , no refund. The blame was put on us apparently for not giving them an Apollo link, and they didn\u2019t explain the \u201cright way\u201d of providing a link.

As I mentioned, tools like Instantly.ai and Saleshandy allow unlimited inboxes, and many of my clients are using them based on their needs. Now that I'm aware of the limitations here, I\u2019ll make sure to mention them when referring your tool to clients. Otherwise, they might not proceed or be satisfied\u2014especially since many clients run small campaigns but connect multiple inboxes for different sending needs.

Clarification needed: I need help understanding this. Our Step 4 shows more leads completed than Step 1, even though the sequence is supposed to go in order. Could this be because the Daily Campaign Email Limit is set to 60 \u2014 and once that limit is hit, the system continues sending emails from later steps for leads that are already eligible, even if not all leads have completed earlier steps like Step 1? So basically, as long as some leads are done with Step 4, the sequence continues \u2014 it doesn\u2019t wait for all leads to go through Step 1 first before moving to the next steps?"

I apologize for the inconvenience this is causing. When you are prompted to upgrade while trying to select a trial, it might be due to the workspace settings. If you or a team member is trying to perform actions like uploading mailboxes or adding email accounts, ensure that they are operating within the correct workspace. If a team member is using their own workspace, which might be on a free trial plan, they could encounter limitations such as a cap on the number of inboxes. They should switch to your workspace to avoid these restrictions. Similarly, if a reseller or team member adds accounts to their default workspace created upon invitation, they might face a cap due to the trial plan. They should switch to your workspace to manage these accounts effectively. \u200b"

The online one I an think of is if the lead responds to one campaign, they aren't removed from subsequent campaigns if they've already been moved to next sequence. Am I overthinking inbox rotation? Also, if I want to setup some new email addresses so I can reduce overall volumes per inbox, is there a service you recommend for registering new inboxes?"

Vulnerability Type: Victim Flooding/DOS/Server Crash Severity: Critical Description: I found victim mailbox flooding due to no rate limit on sending forget password emails. The issue is that there is a speed bump missing in the sending of forgetting password emails area. This would eventually let the attacker spam to *any *random email resulting in the exhaustion of resources on your side. I generated more than 100 forget password email requests and I received a number of forget password email requests within no time and I was able to flood the email. because there is no rate limitation on the forget password email requests area. Steps To Reproduce: Go To forget password page Capture the request and send the request to the Burp Intruder Put the payload on the email parameter Start Attack Proof of concept: The Response after more than 100 Requests. Impact: This poses a significant threat to the integrity and reputation of your organization. Attackers can flood anyone's email by sending the forget password request emails and also they will be able to flood your server with tons of forgetting password requests within no time which will lead to server crashes. And more attackers will be able to execute malicious scripts on the sending of forgetting password requests endpoint. As there's no rate limit placed for the user's security and for your application as well. -Victim Flooding -Dos Attack On Forget Password Requests Endpoint -Forget Password Requests Page Becomes Un Responsive -Server Crash Fix : Set a captcha on sending Forget password requests so attackers will not be able to exploit this vulnerability flaw. Sincerely, John Lee"

There is No Lockout Mechanism ( rate limit ) Description : There is no mitigation, defenses in any way, or lockout mechanism on the login page. A malicious-minded user can continually try to brute force an account password. you can implement a captcha for its protection. I have tried to input 180 incorrect passwords to show you that there is no rate limit on the login page and I have not been locked out. As I observe on other websites they have a lock-out mechanism if a user tries to input 20 incorrect passwords. So you should also have a lock-out mechanism for user account security. Proof Of Concept : Response after more than 170 requests: Now the response of the correct password: Steps to reproduce : 1. Go to https://app.pipl.ai/sign-in 2. Enter any registered email with the wrong password. 3. Capture the request & Send the request to Intruder and add a Payload Marker on the password value. 4. Add the payload for the password field. 5. Start an attack. Impact : There are no lockout mechanisms Attackers can do a lot of tries Attackers Can brute force The Victim's login details as shown in the screenshots. So, due to this vulnerability, the Attacker can Brute force the log-in detail and then take over the account. Mitigation: There should be a captcha on login page to prevent this vulnerability.

So it's me, ni@seamountcapital inviting eric@seamountcapital.com to our account...but eric@seamountcapital.com cannot access the account. I think there is a technical issue hung up somewhere because after he clicks the link to accept my invite he is briefly routed to the 'Accept Invite' page (it flashes for less than 1 second) then he's quickly routed to the regular Sign Up page. After registering it says he's on day 13 of his trial. - Nwamaka"

        "text": "Hi! Thanks for reaching out. Regarding sending at least 150 emails per day from your account, this is generally not recommended due to several potential negative effects: It can trigger spam filters. Sending a high volume of emails from a single account looks like spam to email providers, damaging your sender's reputation. It can overload email servers. Most standard email accounts have daily sending limits, and exceeding these can lead to temporary or permanent restrictions. It's difficult to manage effectively. Tracking engagement, handling bounces, and managing a high volume of individual sends become very challenging in a standard inbox. It could be seen as a security risk. Email providers might flag such activity as suspicious, potentially leading to account suspension. It often results in poor deliverability. Without proper list management and targeting, you'll likely see low engagement and high bounce rates, further harming your ability to reach inboxes."

Instead, our system checks a bunch of things quietly in the background \u2014 like whether the email format looks good, if the domain exists, and if the mail server is actually set up to receive emails. We also ping the server (without sending anything) to see if the address is legit. \u200b For the trickier ones \u2014 like catch-alls or addresses that just won\u2019t give a clear yes/no \u2014 we mark them as \u201crisky\u201d or \u201cunknown\u201d based on a confidence score depending on confirmations we can find elsewhere on the web, like if person mentioned their email in some publicly available profile. That way, you can decide if you want to keep them in or play it safe and leave them out. \u200b Most folks using Pipl.ai don\u2019t need a separate verification tool, but it really depends on how strict you want to be with your lists."

Can I export data if I decide to switch providers? Can I set my own pricing for end-users? Do you offer white-label billing, or do I need to handle payments separately?

Avoid clicking links, downloading attachments, or replying with personal information.\u201d ). The sending emails both have a total warmup of 9 and 10 sent/landed in inbox respectively. I've pasted a screenshot of the message here: Today I sent out less than 10 emails to myself using the \"Test Email\" feature instead. I vary the sending email as well. Many end up in spam, some don't, so it's confusing. Another problem I have is not spam, but it lands in the inbox but there's still the big red banner that appears with a different error ( The sender's email address uses abnormal characters, which might be used to spoof real addresses. Avoid clicking links, downloading attachments, or replying to this message. ). This is when I sent from eric@seamountacquisitions.com (which has no warmup done, 0). I even removed the two dollar signs ($) from the footer, just in case that was the problem. Pasted screenshot here: The only two subject lines I've used thus far is either \"{{company_address}}\" or \"Quick question {{first_name}}\". DKIM SPF and DMARC are all setup correct. I also used your spam word checker, and changed words from \"cash flow\" to \"cashflow\" for example which resolves the highlighted spam words. What is causing this? Even if warmup is not on, shouldn't an email be able to send at least 1 first email that does not land in spam? - Nwamaka"

Accordingly, we demand that Pipl.ai take the following actions immediately: Cease and desist from using \u201cPipl.ai\u201d or any confusingly similar variation in connection with your business, products, or services.

Zach Gordon (DataMiner) Mar 26, 2025, 09:45 PDT Hi Usama, Thanks for your understanding, and yes, scraping these sites is possible. Scraping sub-level data is a common scenario and Data Miner is designed to handle this. But rather than clicking back and forth, Data Miner actually uses URLs for its' automation. This process is called a Crawl. The process is outlined on the following help page: https://dataminer.io/help/crawl . This process requires two recipes. You need to scrape the detail page URLs off of the search results page using one recipe and then Data Miner visits the URL and then scrapes the detail page's data using the second recipe. You can make the recipes yourself by looking at our tutorials here: https://dataminer.io/help/recipe-creator or we can make them for you for $300 total ($150 each). The Crawl feature does also require a paid plan as well, but you can test it with a free plan. You can view paid plans here: https://dataminer.io/pricing Our paid plans are easy to cancel when you don't need them anymore and there is no commitment. You can cancel anytime from your account page here: https://dataminer.io/account Please let me know if you have any questions. \u200b Thank you, Zach Customer Support Agent DataMiner.io Please check out our NEW community page as well.

After launching a campaign, if I later add new leads or sequences, the system does not send emails to them. 2. It seems like once a campaign starts, any additional leads or sequences added afterward are not recognized by the system for email sending. Questions: Q1. Is this a known limitation of your system, or is there a possible technical error? Q2. Have you observed this behavior before, and is there a way to resolve it? Q3. Is there a specific process we should follow to ensure newly added leads or sequences get included in an active campaign? I\u2019d really appreciate your support in clarifying this and finding a solution. Please let me know if you need any additional details from my end. Looking forward to your response. Thanks in advance!"

I've looked at the DNS and used AI to check it and it's telling me they are all good, so i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong.  When i run the warmup its showing 488 warmup sent, 486 landed in inbox 2 saved from spam.  These domains are a couple years old and warmed up previously when using Instantly.

Please advise on customized pricing. Here's my Calendly if you'd like to meet: https://calendly.com/benpadnos/1-1 Pretty time sensitive - hopefully you can get back to us ASAP. Thank you, Ben Padnos, CEO ThinkFISH Mob: (310) 346-7071"

Need a few more inputs: 1) how many accounts you're planning to send with? 2) how many active leads you need to store in your campaigns? 3) any need in dedicated workspaces to manage campaigns for your clients? Let me book a call with you, but please do answer questions above so I can prepare a quote before we meet :-)"

We may ramp to 10 domains fairly quickly because we have 30-40 clients at our agency. Math is 1,980 messages per day, per domain. 2) I don't have an exact number on lead storage, but my expectation is in the 50,000 range to start and ramping from there. 3) As for dedicated workspaces, for now, we can probably manage everything together, but I could see us wanting some individual client accounts. i.e. we'd have specific domains in specific each specific client account. \u200b I hope that's helpful. Happy to meet and discuss in more detail ASAP. Thanks again, Ben"

Warmup Custom Tracking Domain \u2013 Lets you use your own tracking domain for warm-up emails instead of generic ones, reducing the chance of ESPs flagging your links. Warmup Signature \u2013 Adds a signature to your warm-up emails, making them look more human-like and increasing credibility. Warmup Reply Rate \u2013 Adjust how often your warm-up emails get a reply. 35% here means for every 100 warm-up emails sent, 35 will get a reply to boost engagement and inbox trust.
