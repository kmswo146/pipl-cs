      "question": "What are the mailbox limits and pricing for adding extra mailboxes to my business plan?",
      "answer": "For business plan users, there is a fair usage policy with a maximum of 1,000 mailboxes included. If you need to connect more mailboxes, you can add extra slots at a cost of $50 per month for each additional 1,000 mailboxes. For larger expansions, such as 2,000 extra mailboxes, the cost would be $100 per month. The pricing is linear, and the support team can arrange the expansion and update your billing using the payment method on file.",

      "question": "How should I ramp up sending emails from newly warmed Google accounts to ensure good deliverability?",
      "answer": "When starting to send emails from newly warmed Google accounts, it's best to begin with a very low volume, such as 1-3 emails per day for the first week. After a week, you can gradually increase the sending volume to 5-8 emails per day per account. It's also recommended to keep the warmup process running at around 10 warmup emails per day, and consider randomizing the warmup volume for more natural activity. After the initial week, you can enable automatic ramp-up in your inbox settings to safely increase your sending volume.",

This helps recover and preserve your domain and sender reputation, especially if you suspect issues with spam placement.

      "question": "How accurate are warmup tools like 'Warmup Saved from Spam' for measuring email deliverability and spam rates?",
      "answer": "Warmup tools like 'Warmup Saved from Spam' provide a good indication of your email account's health. A warmup score above 90% generally means there are no major issues with your infrastructure setup, and your domain or IP is not blacklisted. However, these tools do not guarantee the same deliverability for your actual campaign emails. This is because warmup emails are exchanged within a controlled pool and often use unique content, while campaign emails are typically sent in bulk with similar content, which can trigger spam filters. Therefore, while warmup metrics are useful for monitoring technical health, they may not fully reflect real-world deliverability for your campaigns.",

This means that no other user's behavior can affect your deliverability. In contrast, some providers group many clients under a single admin panel, which can pose risks to deliverability in the long term.
