      "question": "What are the mailbox limits and pricing for adding extra mailboxes to my business plan?",
      "answer": "Hey! For business plan users, there’s a fair usage policy that covers up to 1000 mailboxes. If you need more than that, you can add extra slots—each extra 1000 mailboxes costs $50 a month. So, if you want 2000 more mailboxes, it’d be $100 a month. The pricing’s pretty straightforward, and our support team can help set everything up and update your billing with your saved payment method. Let us know if you want to expand!",

      "question": "How should I ramp up sending emails from newly warmed Google accounts to ensure good deliverability?",
      "answer": "When you start sending emails from new Google accounts, it’s a good idea to keep it super low at first—like just 1 to 3 emails a day for the first week. After that, you can slowly bump it up to about 5 to 8 emails per day per account. For the warmup process, try to stick to around 10 warmup emails a day, and maybe mix up the number a bit so it looks more natural. Once your first week’s done, you can turn on automatic ramp-up in your inbox settings so your sending volume goes up safely.",

Once that's done, just connect each email account one at a time in Plusvibe by hitting the 'Add new account' button and signing in with the Gmail account you want. Make sure you're logged out of any previous Gmail sessions before you add a new one—this helps you avoid any weird login loops.

As long as you don't change the login info for those accounts, you can bring them back by subscribing again later, and you won't have to reconnect them. Just a heads up, though: you'll still need to keep paying your email provider to keep access to those accounts.",

This gives your domain and sender reputation a chance to recover, especially if you think your emails might be landing in spam. Usually, taking a break for about 14 days works well, but you can stretch it to 30 days if you want to be extra careful.

That’s because warmup emails get sent in a controlled group with unique content, but campaign emails usually go out in bulk and look pretty similar, which spam filters notice.

But no worries—you can still get things working using webhooks! Just set up a webhook in your Pipl (or Plusvibe) account to send data over to a Zapier Webhooks URL.

You’ll get your own Google Workspace admin panel, so your setup is totally isolated from anyone else’s. That way, what other users do won’t mess with your deliverability.\n\nA lot of other providers put lots of clients under the same admin panel, which can end up hurting deliverability over time.

Once that's on, the unsubscribe link will get added to every email you send with that campaign.
